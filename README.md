# Investment-Tracker-and-Portfolio-Manager

"Investment Tracker and Portfolio Manager", is a comprehensive tool designed to manage and track investments in stocks and mutual funds. It allows users to add or remove stocks and mutual funds from their portfolio, and also check the quantity of a particular stock or mutual fund in their portfolio.

The project uses a SQL database to store and retrieve data, and it includes features to handle user registration and login. It also checks for the existence of a stock or mutual fund ID in the user's portfolio before performing operations.

The project is implemented in Java, and it uses JDBC for database connectivity. It also includes features to print all stock IDs and sectors, and to print stock IDs by sector.

In addition, the project includes error handling mechanisms, such as checking if a username is already taken during registration, and checking if the user has enough of a selected stock or mutual fund in their portfolio before allowing them to remove it.

Overall, this project provides a robust and user-friendly platform for managing and tracking investments.
